jazzy - a web framework that makes your apps swing
==================================================

Disclaimer: Jazzy is in early beta stage, documentation is non-existent, you
want to look at other, more popular choices like connect.


Jazzy aims to be more of a modular then functional web framework than an object
oriented one.

The jazzy module provides a server, a router and a config loader. Best is
probably to give an example.

## Usage

This is an example config file, you could put in you app's `etc/config.dev.json`:

```js
    { "server": {
          "http": { "port": 5000 },
          "https": { "port": 5001, "cert": "cert+key.pem" }
      },
      "router": {
          "routes": {
              "*": {
                  "pattern": "^/bootstrap$",
                  "module": "../src/bootstrap.js"
              },
              "web.site.com:5000": [
                  { "pattern": "^/$",
                    "module": "src/controllers/web_site_com/template.js" },
                  { "pattern": "^/(app.js|app.css|app.manifest)$",
                    "module": "src/controllers/web_site_com/pipeline.js" },
                  { "pattern": "^/(css/|img/|js/|favicon.ico$)",
                    "module": "src/controllers/web_site_com/static.js" },
                  {  "module": "src/controllers/web_site_com/error404.js" }
              ]
          } 
    } }
```

## Philosophy

Jazzy tries to trick you into writing more code inside modules, where they can
be read and parsed at launch time, less dynamically. This is *not* for
performance reasons but in an attempt to catch bugs at the earliest possible
stage.

Jazzy puts more emphasis on modules or functions than objects.
